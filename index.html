                        <h3>Here are some fun facts about Pigeons</h3>
                        <p>They can recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.</p>
                        <p>Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills from the sun as a guide and even good memory.</p>
                        <p>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</p>

                    <h3>Panda Fun Facts</h3>
                    <p> The average lifespan of a wild giant panda is 15-20 years. Captive giant pandas can live up to 30 years. The record age for a captive giant panda is 38 years.</p>
                    <p> The eyespots of a giant panda cub are initially in the shape of a circle. As the cub grows, the circles become shaped like a teardrop.</p>
                    <p> Giant pandas are on the brink of extinction, with just over 1,000 pandas left in the world. They are so close to extinction, one reason is because of hunters who sell their fur.</p>
                    <p> pandas are very cute but they are also very dangerous there are three cases of giant panda attacks on humans at the Panda House at Beijing Zoo from September 2006 to June 2009 </p>
